## The Gambler's Fallacies
There are a considerable list of fallacies to do with gambling and forecasting 'the next event' that exist. Books have been written about them - many of them ! In all cases, the fallacy lies in the short-cut of the emotional mind triumphing over the logical rational mind - and, in fairness, money makes it worse - the desire for a natural need overrides the cool, logical consideration of the many fallacies which occur when considering whether a gambling system (aside from horse or dog racing, which has variables far beyond the consideration of simpler yet still very numerically complex mathematics). It would be very fair to say that the mathematical sciences of <b>statistics</b> and <b>number theory</b> both evolved out of a need to circumvent the emotional mind's inability to understand the concepts of chance & probability. Here are some of the most typical that give rise to financial ruin.

<b>The Gambler's Fallacy , or the Monte Carlo Fallacy</b>
This is the most common - its the belief that if an event has occurred <i>less frequently</i> then in the future it is 'likely' to <i>occur more frequently</i>. The reason for the fallacy comes from the inability to distinguish <i>chance</i> from <i>probability</i>. The good example is a a cubic die (or dice if a pair), which has six sides with numbers of 1 to 6 - a common statistical time since before the reign of Julius Caesar, and so millenia old. A perfectly weighted die has the <i>probability</i> of landing on a value of 1 to six for
